Hi, I'm Ben, welcome to my blog!
 
I'm a computer science student in the UK, and I tend to focus on things like web development, the latest in AI, and ogling things I can't afford to buy.

I'm also a big fan of sci-fi dramas (like [Doctor Who](https://ondisneyplus.disney.com/show/doctor-who) and [Severance](https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx)) and police dramas (like [Blue Lights](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0f2cxpr?partner=com.google&campaign=catalogue&medium=referral)).

I very occasionally play video games, I dabble in Minecraft and will generally play whatever Nintendo spits out but I ain't exactly a gamer.
